# Third Eye for Blind Persons 👁️

A low-cost IoT-based smart navigation system designed to assist visually impaired individuals in detecting obstacles and navigating safely using ultrasonic sensors and feedback mechanisms such as vibrations and audio alerts.

## 🚀 Project Description

The **Third Eye for Blind Persons** is a wearable device that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in the user's path and provides real-time feedback through vibration motors or buzzers. This project aims to enhance mobility for visually impaired individuals by giving them an intuitive sense of their environment, reducing the chances of collisions, and improving confidence in independent movement.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔊 **Obstacle Detection** using ultrasonic sensors
- 🎯 **Accurate Range Measurement** (up to 2 meters)
- 💬 **Vibration or Buzzer Feedback** when an object is detected
- ⚡ **Low Power Consumption**
- 🧩 **Compact and Wearable Design**
- 💻 **C-programmed logic with real-time feedback**

## 📈 Circuit Diagram

📷 *[Insert circuit diagram image here]*  
*(Add an image or link to the diagram showing connections between Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, and buzzer/vibration motor.)*

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The ultrasonic sensor continuously sends and receives signals.
2. When an obstacle is detected within a certain threshold (e.g., < 100 cm), the Arduino processes this data.
3. The Arduino triggers a buzzer or vibration motor as feedback.
4. Feedback intensity or beep frequency can be adjusted based on obstacle distance.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Connect all components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the C code provided in the `code/` folder.
3. Power the Arduino using a battery or USB.
4. Test the setup by placing objects at various distances in front of the sensor.
